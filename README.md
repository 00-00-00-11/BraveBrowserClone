# Antimuon

Antimuon is a set of changes, APIs, and scripts used for customizing Chromium to make Brave.
Unlike brave/muon, brave/antimuon shares virtually no original code with electron.

In chemistry, the muon is an elementary particle similar to the electron but with much greater mass.
Antimuon is the antiparticle to muon with opposite charge but equal mass.
