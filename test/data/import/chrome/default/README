The following process was used to create the files in this directory:

1. Create a new profile in Chrome
2. Simulate browsing activity (visit sites, save bookmarks, passwords, etc.)
3. Copy relevant files from the the new profile's data directory to this test data directory

## Login Data

Some of the fields in the Login Data SQLite db, such as saved passwords, are
encrypted by Chrome's OSCrypt class. To test them reliably, Chrome was
launched with the `--use-mock-keychain` argument for the session where the
test login data was simulated:

    /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --use-mock-keychain

AFAICT this argument is only useful on macOS.
